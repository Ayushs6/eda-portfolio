# Global Earthquakes (2024–2025): EDA & Visualizations

Exploratory analysis and visualization of global earthquakes to identify patterns in frequency, magnitude, and depth.

## Data Source
USGS Earthquake Catalog: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/

## Key Fields
- time
- latitude, longitude
- depth (km)
- mag (magnitude)
- magType
- place

## Visualizations
- Choropleth map (earthquake frequency by country)
- Bubble map (magnitude by size + color)
- Density/heatmap (activity hotspots)
- Histogram of magnitudes
- Box plot: depth by magType
- Interactive time-series (magnitude over time)
